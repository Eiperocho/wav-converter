# wav-converter
Converts any file (&lt;~20MB) into a 96kHz Mono WAV file.

I created a Tensor to map Image bytes (0 - 255) to WAV Audio bytes (-32767 - +32767).

The resulting WAV file defaults to 10 minutes long and 95% volume.

You might want to turn your speakers to 10% volume before playing back the WAV.

It is meant to be played through Scalar Tech such as a Succor Punch or powered Orgone Bubble.

But playing it at a low level can have benefits as well.

You can convert a picture of Marijuana and by listening potentially feel stoned.

It captures the energy of the picture as well, and not just the bytes of data.
