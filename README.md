# wav-converter
Converts any file (&lt;~20MB) into a 96kHz Mono WAV file.

I created a Tensor to map image/file bytes (0 - 255) to WAV Audio bytes (-32767 - +32767).

The resulting WAV file defaults to 10 minutes long and 95% volume.

You might want to turn your speakers to 10% volume before playing back the WAV.

It is meant to be played through Scalar Tech such as a Succor Punch or powered Orgone Bubble.

But playing it at a low level can have benefits as well.

For instance, you can convert a picture of Marijuana to WAV, and by listening potentially feel stoned.

It captures the energy of the picture as well, and not just the bytes of data.

You probably want wav_repeater.exe
